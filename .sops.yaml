# This config applies recursively to all sub-directories.

# Multiple directories can use separate SOPS configs.

# Contributors using the sops CLI to create and encrypt files wonâ€™t have to worry
# about specifying the proper key for the target cluster or namespace.
# Therefore, they can just encrypt files with `sops -e file.yaml`

# Private key should be in ./cluster/{name}/sops.agekey

# creation rules are evaluated sequentially, the first match wins
creation_rules:
  # Staging secrets
  - path_regex: .*staging/.*secret.yaml
